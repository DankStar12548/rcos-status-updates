## Last Week's Accomplishments


Kept working on the implementation of the curriculum, flushing it out and making it useful for the future


## This Week's Plan

To finish the implementation for the curriculum and add some more documentation to my files and flush out the status updates as 
they have been a little lackluster in detail (sorry!).


## Anything Blocking?

NA
