## Last Week's Accomplishments

started to idea implementations


## This Week's Plan

continue implementing the game ideas. Im choosing to do a light switch and light bulb idea to showcase the usage of booleans and if/else statements. The students will interact with the buttons that can turn off or on the light bulb


## Anything Blocking?
Just Time.
