## Last Week's Accomplishments

Learning Django and Python, created a basic website


## This Week's Plan

Learn more Django and start implementing the game ideas for teaching


## Anything Blocking?
Time. Classes (especially Data Structures) has been taking large chunks of my time and I have not been able to spend as much time as 
could working on this. Hopefully I will be able to do a lot more next week.
